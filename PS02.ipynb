    "\n",
    "To help clarify the following definitions, let’s start with a simple hypothetical example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Imagine you purchase a bond for $\\$1,000$ with an annual coupon rate of $3\\%$. This means that if you hold the bond for one year, it will pay you $\\$30$ in interest, so at the end of the year, you receive $\\$1,030$.*\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Term Structure:**  \n",
    "This is a way to describe how interest rates change over different time periods. It represents the relationship between various maturities (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, etc.) and the corresponding interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In our hypothetical, the term structure might indicate that for a 1-year term the interest rate is 3%. If you had bonds with different maturities, each could have a different rate, and the collection of these rates forms the term structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discount Factors:**  \n",
    "Discount factors tell us how much a future payment is worth in today’s dollars. They represent the present value of $\\$1$ to be received at a future time. When interest is compounded continuously, the discount factor for a future time $T$ and a continuously compounded spot rate $r$ is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z(0,T) = e^{-rT}.\n",

    "Z(0,1) = e^{-0.03} \\approx 0.97.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- In our hypothetical, this means that receiving $\\$1$ in one year is equivalent to having about $\\$0.97$ today.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spot Rates:**  \n",
    "Spot rates are the interest rates associated with a single cash flow received at a specific future time, assuming continuous compounding. They tell us the effective annual interest rate that would grow a present value to a specific future value. Spot rates are derived from discount factors using the formula:\n",

    "r(0,T) = -\\frac{1}{T}\\ln\\Bigl(Z(0,T)\\Bigr).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "r(0,1) = -\\ln(0.97) \\approx 0.0305,\n",

    "\n",
    "- In our hypothetical, this means that if receiving $\\$1$ in one year is equivalent to having about $\\$0.97$ today, then the effective continuously compounded interest rate for that period is roughly $3.05\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calibrating the Term Structure:**  \n",
    "Calibrating the term structure means adjusting our model so that the theoretical bond prices match actual market prices. We do this by working backwards: using observed bond prices and their future cash flows (like coupon payments), we solve for the discount factors that reflect the current value of future payments. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setting Up the System:**  \n",
    "    To calibrate the term structure, we build a system of equations where each bond’s price equals the sum of its future cash flows, each adjusted by a discount factor. We organize the data into a matrix as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Rows:** Each row represents one bond.\n",
    "   - **Columns:** Each column corresponds to a cash flow time (e.g., 0.5 years, 1 year, etc.).\n",
    "   - **Matrix Entries:** These are the cash flow amounts for each bond at the corresponding time (with the final cash flow including the face value).\n",

    "### 1.2 - Forward Rates from Discount Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "After calibrating the term structure in part (a), we obtained discount factors that represent the current value of \\$1 to be received at various future times. These discount factors provide a snapshot of the market’s interest rates for different maturities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward rates build on this information—they indicate the implied future interest rate for a specific time period. In other words, while spot rates tell you the interest rate for a single cash flow at a future date, forward rates give you the rate for a period between two future dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to compute the forward rates from the discount factors. Specifically, for the period between two consecutive cash flow times (for example, from 0.5 years to 1.0 years), we want to determine the continuously compounded forward rate that is consistent with the discount factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the relationship between discount factors and forward rates. Given the discount factors $Z(0,t)$ for times $t$ and $t+0.5$, the forward rate for the period $(t, t+0.5)$ is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f\\bigl(0,\\,t,\\,t+0.5\\bigr) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\ln Z(0,t) - \\ln Z(0,t+0.5)}{0.5}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula works because when discount factors are expressed as $Z(0,t) = e^{-r(0,t)t}$, the difference in logarithms of the discount factors gives us the effective rate over the period."
