Let $ C $ denote the covariance of the returns of the risky stocks (not the S&P 500), $ \\mathbf{m} $ the vector of their expected (excess) returns. Given a portfolio weight vector $ \\mathbf{w} $ (satisfying $\\sum w_k = 1$), the expected (excess) return and standard deviation for $ \\mathbf{w} $ is:\n",

Compute $ \\mathbf{w}_{MVP}, (\\sigma_{MVP}, \\mu_{MVP}) $ and $ \\mathbf{w}_{MP}, (\\sigma_{MP}, \\mu_{MP}) $ for the minimum variance and market portfolios, respectively. We will also need code that, given a weight vector for a portfolio from the stocks $ \\mathbf{w} $, we can compute the $ (\\sigma,\\mu) $ point; also that we can compute the covariance between two such portfolios; we also want the vector $ \\mathbf{q} $ of covariances with the S&P 500, and the ability to compute the covariance of a portfolio given by $ \\mathbf{w} $ with the S&P 500.\n",

We can consider that portfolio as an approximate solution to an optimization problem (find the portfolio with the no short selling constraint and achieves at least a prescribed expected return that minimizes risk *as measured by standard deviation*). For that optimal portfolio, compute its Sharpe ratio and $ \\beta $.\n"

The \"upper bound\" on your scatter plots represent, essentially, \"efficient frontiers\" with respect to these risk measures (i.e., for a given return, the risk measure is minimized). Recall that for the standard deviation, this \"upper bound\" is a hyperbola, and specifically is a concave curve. Do your results appear to be concave in each of the other cases?\n",
