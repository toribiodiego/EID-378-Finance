Select **M = 5** stocks, and get the daily adjusted closing price over one year for them.\n\n2. Also get the S&P 500 index (daily) over the same year.\n\n3. We also want to determine a risk-free return to use for our portfolio models, based on 3-Month Treasury Bills. This will be explained separately.\n\n4. Compute the daily returns of the stocks and S&P 500 over the year. In order to have a return for each trading day, you should also grab the last trading day of the previous year. For example, for 2014, you should also grab Dec. 31, 2013, in order to compute the return for the first trading day (Jan. 2) of 2014. This idea is called 'pre-windowing.' It is fine if you determine the last trading day of the previous year \"manually\" (i.e., rather than writing systematic code that would \"always\" work).\n\n5. Subtract off the daily risk-free return from the daily returns of the stocks and S&P 500. Going forward, we are going to be working with these excess returns only (I will omit using the word \"excess\" but keep in mind, everything is excess!). For example, if we think in terms of the Markowitz bullet in the $ (\\sigma, \\mu) $ plane, the 'risk-free' point in the graph will actually be the origin (0,0). More generally, going forward in the analysis, you can link what is happening here back to the \"theory\" discussed in the lecture notes by acting as if the risk-free return is 0!\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Section 2 - Modern Portfolio Theory\n\n### Some Equations\n\nLet us write some equations (which apply in this formâ€”with the risk-free return already subtracted off). Let $ C $ denote the covariance of the returns of the risky stocks (not the S&P 500), $ \\mathbf{m} $ the vector of their expected (excess) returns. Given a portfolio weight vector $ \\mathbf{w} $ (satisfying $\\sum w_k = 1$), the expected (excess) return and standard deviation for $ \\mathbf{w} $ is:\n\n$\n\\mu(\\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{m}^T\\mathbf{w} \\\\\n\\sigma(\\mathbf{w}) = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{w}^T C \\mathbf{w}}\n$\n\nAlso let $ \\mathbf{1} $ denote the vector of all ones, as usual.  \nThe weight vectors for the MVP and MP are:\n\n$\n\\mathbf{w}_{MVP} = \\frac{1}{\\mathbf{1}^T C^{-1}\\mathbf{1}} C^{-1}\\mathbf{1} \\\\\n\\mathbf{w}_{MP} = \\frac{1}{\\mathbf{1}^T C^{-1}\\mathbf{m}} C^{-1}\\mathbf{m}\n$\n\nFrom these you can compute the $\\mu, \\sigma$.\n\nIf you have two portfolios (of the risky stocks only) with weight vectors $ \\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2 $, the corresponding returns $ r_1, r_2 $ have covariance given by:\n\n$\ncov(r_1, r_2) = \\mathbf{w}_1^T C \\mathbf{w}_2\n$\n\nOtherwise, if you have the actual set of returns over a period of time, you can compute the covariance directly from the data. For example, you can do this to compute the covariance between one of your stocks and the S&P 500. If you store the covariances between each stock and the S&P 500 in a vector $ \\mathbf{q} $, then the covariance between a portfolio $ \\mathbf{w} $ of the stocks and the S&P 500 would be:\n\n$\ncov(r_{\\mathbf{w}}, r_{S\\&P500}) = \\mathbf{q}^T\\mathbf{w}\n$","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Section 3 - Data Analysis\n\n1. Using the data for the full year, we want to get the vector of expected returns and covariance matrix of the returns of the **M = 5** stocks, and the covariance between each stock and the S&P 500. Compute $ \\mathbf{w}_{MVP}, (\\sigma_{MVP}, \\mu_{MVP}) $ and $ \\mathbf{w}_{MP}, (\\sigma_{MP}, \\mu_{MP}) $ for the minimum variance and market portfolios, respectively. We will also need code that, given a weight vector for a portfolio from the stocks $ \\mathbf{w} $, we can compute the $ (\\sigma,\\mu) $ point; also that we can compute the covariance between two such portfolios; we also want the vector $ \\mathbf{q} $ of covariances with the S&P 500, and the ability to compute the covariance of a portfolio given by $ \\mathbf{w} $ with the S&P 500.\n\n2. Look at the MVP and MP weight vectors. Do they involve short-selling?\n\n3. Compute the Sharpe ratio and $ \\beta $ for each of the **M = 5** stocks, the S&P 500, and the MVP. Compute the covariance between the individual stocks, and the MVP and MP portfolios with the S&P 500. Display these results in a reasonable form, such as a table. Also provide a quick summary of which of these are positively or negatively correlated with the S&P 500.\n\n4. Generate **N = 100** random $ \\mathbf{w} $ vectors with **no short selling**; they have to satisfy the constraint that $\\sum_{k=1}^{M} w_k = 1$. To do this I suggest: (1) generate $ M $ independent numbers uniformly from 0 to 1, say $(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_5)$, and then (2) set $ w_k = x_k / (\\sum x_k) $, i.e., normalize them to sum to 1. I suggest you store these vectors in an array (dataframe) as you will be using them again later!\n\n5. Compute the $ (\\sigma, \\mu) $ point for each of these vectors, and create a scatter plot of these $ (\\sigma, \\mu) $, also put in $ (\\sigma_{MVP}, \\mu_{MVP}) $, and $ (\\sigma_{MP}, \\mu_{MP}) $ and also compute and plot $ (\\sigma_{SP}, \\mu_{SP}) $ for the S&P 500. Also draw the CAL on your graph (remember, the \"risk-free\" point is now (0,0)).\n\n6. Find the median of the expected returns of those 100 portfolios that involve no short-selling, say $ \\mu_{med} $. Find the \"best\" portfolio (among those you created) whose return satisfies $ \\mu \\geq \\mu_{med} $, i.e., among all such, the $ \\sigma $ is minimum. Highlight that portfolio. We can consider that portfolio as an approximate solution to an optimization problem (find the portfolio with the no short selling constraint and achieves at least a prescribed expected return that minimizes risk *as measured by standard deviation*). For that optimal portfolio, compute its Sharpe ratio and $ \\beta $.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Section 4 - V@R and CV@R\n\n1.

The \"upper bound\" on your scatter plots represent, essentially, \"efficient frontiers\" with respect to these risk measures (i.e., for a given return, the risk measure is minimized). Recall that for the standard deviation, this \"upper bound\" is a hyperbola, and specifically is a concave curve. Do your results appear to be concave in each of the other cases?\n\nHere, I asked you to create 100 random portfolios. You may want to try more, if your computer can handle it. If you work with 1000, do your scatter plots and final \"optimal\" choices change considerably?\n\nOne more comment: in many cases, the V@R and CV@R are computed using the formulas that apply for the case of a Gaussian model. This may be useful in achieving a more systematic approach to solving the optimization problem, rather than the crude \"random search\" given here, but again presumes the Gaussian model is accurate.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Section 6 - Some Extra Things to Try [Optional]\n\nAs mentioned above, a common approach to V@R/CV@R is to presume a Gaussian distribution.

However, considering the experiment above, there is a flaw in directly measuring the quantiles and using that to obtain the CV@R. In fact, it may very well be that the model-based approach to CV@R could give superior results! **WHY?**","metadata":{}}]}
