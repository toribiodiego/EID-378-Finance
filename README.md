> This repository contains code for **EID378: Finance**—a 3-credit course taught by **Professor Fred L. Fontaine** at The Cooper Union. The coursework covers fundamental principles of finance, financial data analysis in Python, and hands-on programming assignments that range from asset return simulations to portfolio optimization and risk measurement.

## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to finance by covering fundamental principles such as asset valuation, time value of money, and risk-return tradeoffs, alongside advanced topics including portfolio optimization, bond pricing, and risk measurement. Through hands-on programming assignments in Python, students work with real financial data, learn to construct yield curves and term structures, and analyze risk using measures like V@R and CV@R. The curriculum also explores modern portfolio theory, CAPM, and algorithmic trading, equipping students with the quantitative and analytical tools necessary for practical financial analysis.


## Codebase Structure

- **PS01** – *Financial Calculations and Simulations*  
  Covers several foundational financial exercises:
  - Simulating asset returns using Monte Carlo methods.
  - Computing expected returns, standard deviations, and correlations from probabilistic models.
  - Analyzing short-selling strategies and balance sheet implications.
  - Exploring linear factor models to understand systematic versus idiosyncratic risks.
  - Constructing replicating portfolios for derivative pricing.

- **PS02** – *Bond Pricing and Term Structure Analysis*  
  Focuses on:
  - Solving for discount factors and constructing the term structure via backsubstitution.
  - Computing forward rates and yield-to-maturity (YTM) for bonds.
  - Applying the Nelson-Siegel model to derive bond prices and YTM curves.
  - Visualizing term structures and forward rate curves.

- **PS03** – *Portfolio Optimization and Risk Analysis*  
  Involves:
  - Estimating expected returns and covariances for a set of stocks and the S&P 500.
  - Calculating the minimum variance and market portfolios using modern portfolio theory.
  - Generating random portfolios under no-short-selling constraints and visualizing the efficient frontier.
  - Computing risk measures including Sharpe ratios, betas, V@R, and CV@R, and comparing risk profiles through scatter plots.
